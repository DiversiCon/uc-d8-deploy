Non-local split includes those things which are unique to the hosted version of the site.

This includes:
* Acquia/Platform related modules/configuration.
* SSO/LDAP/Authentication modules/configuration.
* Other things that are not applicable/compatible with local environments.

For this particular project config_ignore is included here because the only ignored
settings are related specifically to Acquia modules.
