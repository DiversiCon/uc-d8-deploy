# button component

This is basic styling for global buttons throughout the site. Button styles change depending on the background color of their container. So, a button inside a `s-bg` div will have a different hover style than a button in a `s-bg-secondary` container.

## Usage

```html
<a class="c-button" href="#">Button Text</a>
```
