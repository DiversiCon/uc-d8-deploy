# UC Pull Quote Component

This component handles embedding of pull quotes with associated sharing functionality.

When the Twitter icon is clicked, the quote is combined with the attribution and the URL to be shared.

The attribution prop is optional. 

## Usage

```html
<uc-pullquote
  quote="“My laziness means I only work on questions that are intriguing...”"
  attribution="Prof. Richard Thaler">
</uc-pullquote>
```
