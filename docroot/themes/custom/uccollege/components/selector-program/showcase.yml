          in biochemical and biophysical sciences. Students in this program are given the opportunity to study chemistry and physics
          of macromolecules, mechanisms of actions of enzymes and hormones, molecular and cellular biology, biotechnology, and other
          related fields.</p>

        text: <p>Biology is the study of organisms and their adaptations to the pressures of natural selection. This program provides
          the knowledge of biology essential for understanding many of the most pressing problems of modern life and for intelligent
          involvement in their eventual solution. The goals of the program are to give students an understanding of currently accepted
          concepts in biology and the experimental support for these concepts and an appreciation of the gaps in our current understanding
          and the opportunities for new research in this field. The Biology major offers specializations in Ecology and Evolution,
          Endocrinology, Genetics, Immunology, Microbiology, and Neuroscience.</p>

        text: '<p>Chemistry is concerned with the preparation, composition, and structure of matter and with the equilibrium and
          kinetic laws that govern its transformations. The BA and BS degrees in chemistry are designed to provide a broad foundation
          in the three principal branches of the science: inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry. The BS degree offers a intensive
          program of study while the BA degree provides a wide opportunity for elective freedom and for the pursuit of interdisciplinary
          interests.</p>'

          be defined by nations (e.g., Chinese, Roman, U.S., international history) or by genres (e.g., legal, cultural, gender
          history). Topics include the history of revolution, slavery, sexuality, colonialism, ethnicity, war, and work. History
          is excellent preparation for a wide field of endeavors from law, government, and public policy to the arts and business.</p>

        text: <p>The program in Law, Letters, and Society is concerned with law in civilian and customary legal systems, both historically
          and contemporaneously. The programâ€™s organizing premise is that law is a tool of social organization and control, not
          simply an expression of will or aspiration, and that it is best understood by careful study of both rhetorical artifacts
          and empirical consequences of its application.</p>
