          Sarosh Rana, MD, cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. She is an expert in the
          diagnosis and management of preeclampsia – a condition characterized by high blood
          pressure during pregnancy. Dr. Rana also performs high-level ultrasounds, which provide a
          greater assessment of the fetus than traditional ultrasounds.

        Dr. Rana aims to improve maternal and fetal outcomes through research on preeclampsia. Her
        research over the last several years has focused on demonstrating clinical utility for
        angiogenic biomarkers in prediction of adverse outcomes among women with suspected
        preeclampsia. She is also testing the idea that these biomarkers will prove superior in
        predicting adverse outcomes, leading to reductions in maternal and fetal deaths related to
        preeclampsia in developing countries such as Haiti. Dr. Rana performs collaborative research
        evaluating the relationships between increased levels of angiogenic factors and immediate,
        as well as future, cardiac performance. Dr. Rana's work has been funded by several notable
        organizations, including the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart
        Association.

        A dedicated teacher, Dr. Rana trains residents and fellows on the use of ultrasound imaging,
        as well as the management of women with complex pregnancies. She also serves as a mentor on
        various clinical, basic science and translational research projects; these mentored research
        projects have resulted in multiple national and international conference presentations, and
        published manuscripts.
