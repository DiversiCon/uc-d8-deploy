			<p>Known for its gothic architecture, the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park is home to nearly 14,000
				undergraduate and graduate students and six professional schools.</p>

			<h2>Hyde Park and Chicago</h2>
			<p>The campus is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood, just seven miles south of downtown Chicago. Hyde
				Park is a historic area known for its political and social activism, strong sense of community, and many
				historic and architectural landmarks. It has been cited as one of the most racially and economically
				integrated urban communities in the United States. Hyde Park boasts dozens of museums and cultural
				institutions, a wide variety of cafes and bakeries, and a large number of one-of-a-kind shops and
				independent bookstores. Our neighborhood will soon be home to another distinctive attraction: the Obama
				Presidential Center.</p>

			<p>Only a twenty minute train or bus ride from downtown Chicago, the city is literally at your doorstep.
				Chicago is the third-largest metropolitan area in the nation, home to more than 200 theaters and art
				galleries, 552 parks, and 26 miles of lakefront trails. Students can take advantage of these attractions
				by using the city's robust public transit system, which includes buses, trains, and the L--our nickname
				for the elevated rapid transit trains.</p>

			<h2>University of Chicago Medical Center & Facilities</h2>
			<p>Our students practice medicine in a number of state-of-the-art facilities. The 10-story, 1.2 million
				square-foot Center for Care and Discovery serves as the core of the medical campus. Additional campus
				facilities include the Comer Children's Hospital, Duchossois Center for Advanced Medicine, and Mitchell
				Hospital. We offer clinical experiences at NorthShore University HealthSystem, La Rabida Children's
				Hospital, and Lake Shore HealthCare and Rehabilitation Centre.</p>
