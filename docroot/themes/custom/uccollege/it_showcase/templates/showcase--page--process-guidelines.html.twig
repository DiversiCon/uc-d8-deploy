      <p>1. In the BSD, the definitive statement of criteria is "Pathways for successful faculty development and
        promotion" (May 2011), <a href="http://tiny.cc/BSDPathways">http://tiny.cc/BSDPathways</a>.</p>

      <p>2. Each department should distribute to its faculty its policy regarding which BSD faculty tracks and ranks may
        attend faculty meetings and vote on departmental recommendations in addition to any departmental processes to be
        followed, e.g., whether a research seminar or an ad hoc committee is required in particular cases. This policy
        should be distributed annually to all faculty and individually to faculty candidates for reappointment,
        promotion, or tenure. Departments have reasonable discretion in setting these policies, excepting that in tenure
        recommendations the votes of the tenured faculty must be reported separately from those of other eligible
        voters. If a department needs to make an exception to its policies and/or these guidelines, it should first notify the
        Office of Academic Affairs[<a href="#">2</a>], which will seek advice as to whether the intended exception poses
        any issues. Additionally, appointive actions should be guided by the following resolution endorsed by the department chairs
        of the BSD:</p>

      <blockquote><p>The Shils Report states: "All academic appointments to University faculties must be treated with great
          seriousness. They should, wherever it is at all possible, be made on the basis of careful study by members of
          the appointive body... All appointments...must be conducted with the same thorough deliberation, the same
          careful
          study of relevant documentation and other evidence, and the same process of consultation." The BSD concurs
          with
          this statement. In the BSD, the deliberations preceding votes on appointments, reappointments, promotions, or
          tenure should be among the most robust and open discussions that the faculty have.</p>

        <p>Chairs and Section Chiefs can facilitate our objectives by:
          (a)Making all relevant documentation and evidence available to the faculty eligible to vote
          (b)Providing ample notice of discussions so that faculty can arrange their schedules to participate or
          provide</p>

        <p>written/electronic assessments for consideration in the discussion
          (c)Providing sufficient time for a complete discussion
          (d)Ensuring that all candidates receive full discussion whether the expected outcome is positive or
          negative</p>

        <p>In turn, frank and robust discussions rely upon the faculty's observance of strict confidentiality.
          Nonetheless,
          candidates for appointive actions should be fully apprised well in advance of relevant deadlines for
          submission of
          materials and decision announcements, the process of decision-making, and the criteria to be applied. When any
          exceptions to these guidelines are necessary, they should be disclosed in advance to the BSD Office of
          Academic
          Affairs2, which will arrange for their review, or to the Dean.</p></blockquote>

      <p>3. The primary responsibility for applying the criteria and evaluating a candidate&apos;s performance in
        relation to them lies with the departmental faculty eligible to vote.</p>
